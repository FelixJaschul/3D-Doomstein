Camera Class:
Controlling the cameras position and orientation in a 2D grid -> enabling movement and rotation based on toggling diffrent keys when pressed.

Fields:
xPos   + yPos   -> Tracks cameras position
xDir   + yDir   -> Direction vectors -> Where the cameras looking
xPlane + yPlane -> Projection calculation or depth handling

Constants:
MOVE_SPEED = 0.06
ROTATION_SPEED = 0.045

Constructor: 
Initializes the cameras position, direction vectors using:
x  + y  -> initial position
xd + yd -> look direction
xp + yp -> plane values

KeyHandling:
keyPressed   + keyReleased        -> Processes keyboard input to toggle the  movement directions
left + right + forward + backward -> Movement directions

Update Method:
Updates Cameras position based on pressed Keys
forward + backward -> Moves the camera along its current vector if the target cell in the grid is empty (no wall in front)
right   + left     -> Rotates the camera using rotation matrices to change its look direction, adjusting xDir + yDir + xPlane + yPlane
